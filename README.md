## Introduction
Simple QrCode is an easy to use wrapper for the popular Laravel framework based on the great work provided by [Bacon/BaconQrCode](https://github.com/Bacon/BaconQrCode).  We created an interface that is familiar and easy to install for Laravel users.

<a id="docs-configuration"></a>
## Configuration

#### Composer

First, add the Simple QrCode package to your `require` in your `composer.json` file:

	"require": {
		"simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode": "1.3.*"
	}

Next, run the `composer update` command.

#### Service Provider

###### Laravel 4
Register the `SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode\QrCodeServiceProvider` in your `app/config/app.php` within the `providers` array.

###### Laravel 5
Register the `SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode\QrCodeServiceProvider::class` in your `config/app.php` within the `providers` array.

#### Aliases

###### Laravel 4
Finally, register the `'QrCode' => 'SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode\Facades\QrCode'` in your `app/config/app.php` configuration file within the `aliases` array.

###### Laravel 5
Finally, register the `'QrCode' => SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode\Facades\QrCode::class` in your `config/app.php` configuration file within the `aliases` array.

## Simple Ideas

#### Print View

One of the main items that we use this package for is to have QrCodes in all of our print views.  This allows our customers to return to the original page after it is printed by simply scanning the code.  We achieved this by adding the following into our footer.blade.php file.

	<div class="visible-print text-center">
		{!! QrCode::size(100)->generate(Request::url()); !!}
		<p>Scan me to return to the original page.</p>
	</div>

#### Embed A QrCode

You may embed a qrcode inside of an e-mail to allow your users to quickly scan.  The following is an example of how to do this with Laravel.

    //Inside of a blade template.
	<img src="{!!$message->embedData(QrCode::format('png')->generate('Embed me into an e-mail!'), 'QrCode.png', 'image/png')!!}">

<a id="docs-usage"></a>
## Usage

#### Basic Usage

Using the QrCode Generator is very easy.  The most basic syntax is:

	QrCode::generate('Make me into a QrCode!');

This will make a QrCode that says "Make me into a QrCode!"

#### Generate

`Generate` is used to make the QrCode.

	QrCode::generate('Make me into a QrCode!');

>Heads up! This method must be called last if using within a chain.

`Generate` by default will return a SVG image string.  You can print this directly into a modern browser within Laravel's Blade system with the following:

	{!! QrCode::generate('Make me into a QrCode!'); !!}

The `generate` method has a second parameter that will accept a filename and path to save the QrCode.

	QrCode::generate('Make me into a QrCode!', '../public/qrcodes/qrcode.svg');

#### Format Change

>QrCode Generator is setup to return a SVG image by default.

>Watch out! The `format` method must be called before any other formatting options such as `size`, `color`, `backgroundColor`, and `margin`.

Three formats are currently supported; PNG, EPS, and SVG.  To change the format use the following code:

	QrCode::format('png');  //Will return a PNG image
	QrCode::format('eps');  //Will return a EPS image
	QrCode::format('svg');  //Will return a SVG image

#### Size Change

>QrCode Generator will by default return the smallest size possible in pixels to create the QrCode.

You can change the size of a QrCode by using the `size` method. Simply specify the size desired in pixels using the following syntax:

    QrCode::size(100);

#### Color Change

>Be careful when changing the color of a QrCode.  Some readers have a very difficult time reading QrCodes in color.

All colors must be expressed in RGB (Red Green Blue).  You can change the color of a QrCode by using the following:

	QrCode::color(255,0,255);

Background color changes are also supported and be expressed in the same manner.

	QrCode::backgroundColor(255,255,0);

#### Margin Change

The ability to change the margin around a QrCode is also supported.  Simply specify the desired margin using the following syntax:

	QrCode::margin(100);

#### Error Correction

Changing the level of error correction is easy.  Just use the following syntax:

	QrCode::errorCorrection('H');

The following are supported options for the `errorCorrection` method.

| Error Correction | Assurance Provided |
| --- | --- |
| L | 7% of codewords can be restored. |
| M | 15% of codewords can be restored. |
| Q | 25% of codewords can be restored. |
| H | 30% of codewords can be restored. |

>The more error correction used; the bigger the QrCode becomes and the less data it can store. Read more about [error correction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code#Error_correction).

#### Encoding

Change the character encoding that is used to build a QrCode.  By default `ISO-8859-1` is selected as the encoder.  Read more about [character encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) You can change this to any of the following:

    QrCode::encoding('UTF-8')->generate('Make me a QrCode with special symbols ♠♥!!');

| Character Encoder |
| --- |
| ISO-8859-1 |
| ISO-8859-2 |
| ISO-8859-3 |
| ISO-8859-4 |
| ISO-8859-5 |
| ISO-8859-6 |
| ISO-8859-7 |
| ISO-8859-8 |
| ISO-8859-9 |
| ISO-8859-10 |
| ISO-8859-11 |
| ISO-8859-12 |
| ISO-8859-13 |
| ISO-8859-14 |
| ISO-8859-15 |
| ISO-8859-16 |
| SHIFT-JIS |
| WINDOWS-1250 |
| WINDOWS-1251 |
| WINDOWS-1252 |
| WINDOWS-1256 |
| UTF-16BE |
| UTF-8 |
| ASCII |
| GBK |
| EUC-KR |

>An error of `Could not encode content to ISO-8859-1` means that the wrong character encoding type is being used.  We recommend `UTF-8` if you are unsure.

#### Merge

The `merge` method merges an image over a QrCode.  This is commonly used to placed logos within a QrCode.

    QrCode::merge($filename, $percentage);

    //Generates a QrCode with an image centered in the middle.
    QrCode::format('png')->merge('path-to-image.png')->generate();

    //Generates a QrCode with an image centered in the middle.  The inserted image takes up 30% of the QrCode.
    QrCode::format('png')->merge('path-to-image.png', .3)->generate();

>The `merge` method only supports PNG at this time. The 'merge' path is relative to app base path. If you are outside of Laravel pass absolute path.

>You should use a high level of error correction when using the `merge` method to ensure that the QrCode is still readable.  We recommend using `errorCorrection('H')`.

![Merged Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimpleSoftwareIO/simple-qrcode/master/docs/imgs/merged-qrcode.png?raw=true)

#### Advance Usage

All methods support chaining.  The `generate` method must be called last and any `format` change must be called first.  For example you could run any of the following:

	QrCode::size(250)->color(150,90,10)->backgroundColor(10,14,244)->generate('Make me a QrCode!');
	QrCode::format('png')->size(399)->color(40,40,40)->generate('Make me a QrCode!');

You can display a PNG image without saving the file by providing a raw string and encoding with `base64_encode`.

	<img src="data:image/png;base64, {!! base64_encode(QrCode::format('png')->size(100)->generate('Make me into an QrCode!')) !!} ">

## Helpers

#### What are helpers?

Helpers are an easy way to create QrCodes that cause a reader to perform a certain action when scanned.  

#### E-Mail

This helper generates an e-mail qrcode that is able to fill in the e-mail address, subject, and body.

	QrCode::email($to, $subject, $body);
	
	//Fills in the to address
	QrCode::email('foo@bar.com');
	
	//Fills in the to address, subject, and body of an e-mail.
	QrCode::email('foo@bar.com', 'This is the subject.', 'This is the message body.');
	
	//Fills in just the subject and body of an e-mail.
	QrCode::email(null, 'This is the subject.', 'This is the message body.');
	
#### Geo

This helper generates a latitude and longitude that a phone can read and open the location up in Google Maps or similar app.

	QrCode::geo($latitude, $longitude);
	
	QrCode::geo(37.822214, -122.481769);
	
#### Phone Number

This helper generates a QrCode that can be scanned and then dials a number.

	QrCode::phoneNumber($phoneNumber);
	
	QrCode::phoneNumber('555-555-5555');
	QrCode::phoneNumber('1-800-Laravel');
	
#### SMS (Text Messages)

This helper makes SMS messages that can be prefilled with the send to address and body of the message.

	QrCode::SMS($phoneNumber, $message);
	
	//Creates a text message with the number filled in.
	QrCode::SMS('555-555-5555');
	
	//Creates a text message with the number and message filled in.
	QrCode::SMS('555-555-5555', 'Body of the message');

#### WiFi

This helpers makes scannable QrCodes that can connect a phone to a WiFI network.

	QrCode::wiFi([
		'encryption' => 'WPA/WEP',
		'ssid' => 'SSID of the network',
		'password' => 'Password of the network',
		'hidden' => 'Whether the network is a hidden SSID or not.'
	]);
	
	//Connects to an open WiFi network.
	QrCode::wiFi([
		'ssid' => 'Network Name',
	]);
	
	//Connects to an open, hidden WiFi network.
	QrCode::wiFi([
		'ssid' => 'Network Name',
		'hidden' => 'true'
	]);
	
	//Connects to an secured, WiFi network.
	QrCode::wiFi([
		'ssid' => 'Network Name',
		'encryption' => 'WPA',
		'password' => 'myPassword'
	]);
	
>WiFi scanning is not currently supported on Apple Products.

##Usage Outside of Laravel

You may use this package outside of Laravel by instantiating a new `BaconQrCodeGenerator` class.

    use SimpleSoftwareIO\QrCode\BaconQrCodeGenerator;

    $qrcode = new BaconQrCodeGenerator;
    $qrcode->size(500)->generate('Make a qrcode without Laravel!');
